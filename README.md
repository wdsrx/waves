# Shipping Orders Status in Real Time

## Overview of the Project

This project establish a connection with a SQL database, pull the needed information, transform it using pandas and numpy, export the modified data to a JSON file, transform the JSON data into a pie chart and a table, and finally pushes the code to a website everytime there is a change in the data.
